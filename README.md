# jsPlatformer
A brief platformer game I made in HTML/CSS/Javascript. Yes, I drew all of the assets myself. To play the game, simply open the "platformer.html" file after downloading the project. Just... beware its very rough around the edges.

If you want the default character I designed the game around, press Q on the menu.
